**Following is what you need for this book:**
SwiftUI Projects is intended for anyone who is already comfortable with Swift. We do
not cover Swift topics in detail, so you need to be familiar with these already. All of the
SwiftUI topics are taught as if this is the first time you've learned them and will gradually
get more difficult.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-11).
